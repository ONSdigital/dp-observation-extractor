================

* Consumes a Kafka message specifying a CSV file hosted on AWS S3
* Retrieves the file and produces a Kafka message for each row in the CSV

### Getting started

You may want vault to run this service:

- Run `brew install vault`
- Run `vault server -dev`

* Clone the repo `go get github.com/ONSdigital/dp-csv-splitter`
* Run the application `make debug`

#### Running in isolation
* run kafka consumer / producer apps
* run local S3 store?

### Kafka scripts

Scripts for updating and debugging Kafka can be found [here](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-data-tools)(dp-data-tools)
